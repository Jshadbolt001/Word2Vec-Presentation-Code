Requirements to run this code:

- Ensure NLTK is installed. If not, install it using `pip install nltk`.

- Download the Brown Corpus, which is commonly used in NLP tasks, by running the following Python code:
  ```python
  import nltk
  nltk.download('brown')

- then install gensim with `pip install gensim`


- then rollback scipy with `pip  install scipy ==1.10.1`
This is required because gensim uses the 'triu' class which was deprecated in newer versions.

-then "pip install matplotlib"
This is used to create the visualizations seen in the presentation

Run the file `train_models.py` first before running any other file. This only needs to be down once unless you want to retrain.
